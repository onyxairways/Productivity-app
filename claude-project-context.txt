PROJECT CONTEXT — READ FIRST

Goal:
Build a full-stack productivity / task app to learn Python (backend), Angular (frontend), and core full-stack concepts, with the ability to add AI features later.

High-level plan:
1. Environment setup (safe, clean dev setup on macOS)
2. Python basics → backend fundamentals
3. Python API (FastAPI preferred)
4. SQLite database
5. Angular frontend
6. Connect frontend ↔ backend
7. Add productivity features (priority, due dates, completion)
8. Add basic AI-style features later
9. Polish & deploy

Current system:
- macOS (Apple Silicon MacBook Air)
- zsh shell
- iTerm2 will be used as the main terminal
- VS Code for editing
- Claude Code installed via install.sh
- Claude binary location: ~/.local/bin/claude
- PATH updated in ~/.zshrc
- `claude --help` works

Project structure (already created):
~/dev/productivity-app/
├── backend/
└── frontend/

Important preferences:
- I want small, testable steps
- I want exact commands, not vague instructions
- I prefer understanding over copy-paste magic
- I want to avoid breaking system Python
- I am learning, but I work in IT and can handle technical detail
- Momentum matters more than perfection

What I want next:
- Choose Python environment strategy (Miniconda vs venv)
- Set up backend first (FastAPI)
- Create the smallest working API endpoint (/health)
- Run backend locally
- Then move to frontend

Rules for the assistant:
- Be structured
- Don’t skip steps
- Explain *why* briefly when it matters
- Ask before making big tooling decisions
- Treat this like a real project, not a tutorial
